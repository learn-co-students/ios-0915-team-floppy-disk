#Harpy

Harpy is a literal music discovery app.  As you explore your hometown or city, you will see song posts made by other users.  Tap on the post to listen to the song and see who placed it in that spot.  Share a song of your own at your favorite places, or whenever the mood strikes you.  When others pass by that location, they'll be able to see your post and listen to the song you chose.

This app is the final project of Team Floppy Disk as a part of Flatiron School's iOS Mobile Development Course.

We're using [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/?hl=en) to show locations and to place the markers.  We link to [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/) to gain access to the songs to search and play them.  If a user has a premium account, they have the chance to log in to it through our app.  If they don't, they can still hear some of the song.  We also use [Parse](https://parse.com/) and [ParseUI](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/ParseUI-iOS) to store log in data, user profiles, and the song post information, including the name of the artist and album, the user who posted the song, and the coordinates it's attributed to.
